Samples to get the following data:

a)
Q: For a given list of products, get the names of all categories in which products are presented;
A: with `GET: /products` we'll get full list with products and categories for each of them

b)
Q: For a given category, get a list of offers for all products from this category and its child categories;
A: fast and simple - `GET /category/{id}/flat` - we'll get flat array with current subtree and products inside. then just `foreach`.

c)
Q: For a given list of categories, get the number of product offers in each category;
A: since each of categories can have own subtree of children, I guess the best solution is getting info for each (by `GET: /category/{id}/flat`) and then merge it.
   or, of course, if that request will be necessary often - we can add special endpoint for it (with the same as above just inside)

d)
Q: For a given list of categories, get the total number of unique product offers;
A: the same as paragraph `c`

e)
Q: For a given category, get its full path in the tree (breadcrumb).
A: with `GET: /category/{id}` we'll get the full category info with ancestors-array also. then just `foreach`.
